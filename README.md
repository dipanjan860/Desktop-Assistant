# Desktop-Assistant
 It is a Desktop Assistant program in Python that allows users to control their computers through voice commands. With this assistant, users can easily open websites and apps with- out having to use their keyboard or mouse. For instance, if a user says "Open Google" the assistant will open the Google Chrome browser. Similarly, on saying "Open Word" the assistant will launch Microsoft Word. It can also tell the current Date & Time of the system.
